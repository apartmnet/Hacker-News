Hacker News Mobile Interface
=============

This is a simple implementation of the most bare-bones version of Hacker News, 
mobile optimized.

Features
--------

The following features exist, to some extent.

* Mobile optimized interface for home and news items page
* iOS home screen icon


Things That Don't Work
----------------------

The following features do not work, as this was a 2-hour unofficial hack.

* Login
* Commenting
* Voting


Notes
-----

This is an extremely limited proof of concept, designed to simplify the 
experience of browsing Hacker News only. Forging auth was beyond the scope
of the proof of concept, so therefore commenting and voting are out. One 
could argue that removing the concept of voting and commenting from Hacker News
invalidates the purpose of it, and I wouldn't necessarily argue with that, but 
providing an easier browsing experience was the primary purpose of this hack,
and at that it excels.
